- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adammyya
- 👀 I’m interested in trekking, a little bit of literature and programing 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and it's other extensions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which will help me grow as a programmer and will help me look beyond the ordinary.
- 📫 How to reach me: On github only (not a person with a well social background, I'm working on it ;-)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am such a bore, sorry!
  Hope you'll find my profile and help me and I'll do the same if I'm capable.
